Will be adding lecture notes in the coming days...

Helpful resources:

- ``Deep Learning'' by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville
- ``Understanding Deep Learning'' by J.D. Prince

  Andrew Ng's Coursera lectures on Deep learning are especially insightful: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
